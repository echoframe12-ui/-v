## What Is Ω∞v?

Ω∞v Oceanicos is a system for building trustworthy software through continuous verification and evidence-based evolution.

### The Core Loop

```
Observe → Verify → Attest → Record → Display → Learn → Return
```

Every observation:
1. **Observed** with metadata (who, when, what, confidence)
2. **Verified** against rules with evidence paths
3. **Attested** with cryptographic signatures
4. **Recorded** in an immutable event log
5. **Displayed** to users and systems
6. **Learned** from to improve future verification
7. **Returned** to observation with better knowledge

### Why It Matters

Most systems assert correctness. We verify it.

- **Without verification**: "The system is healthy" (hope-based)
- **With verification**: "The system returned 200ms responses for 1000 consecutive requests; verified by rules v1.2.0; signed at 2026-08-07T10:30:02Z" (evidence-based)

## Key Principles

### 1. Verification Before Everything
No claim without evidence. No evolution without verification.

### 2. Continuous Observation
Systems are never final. Observation is ongoing.

### 3. Evidence-Based Trust
Trust emerges from verifiable provenance, not authority.

### 4. Graceful Pluralism
One system, many interpreters. Consensus and dissent both matter.

### 5. Recursive Completeness
Every component contains the whole verification loop.

## Current Phase

**Phase 1 & 2: Core Loop & Formless Swarm** (Complete & Verified)

- ✅ Project manifest, charter, and Formless constitution ([FORMLESS.md](FORMLESS.md))
- ✅ Core verification loop (`Observe → Verify → Attest → Record → Learn → Return`)
- ✅ Express API Server with `/complete-loop`, `/swarm`, `/log`, `/metrics`
- ✅ `@omega-v/agents` Formless Swarm engine (Observer, Verifier, Security, Governance, Learning)
- ✅ Terminal CLI tool (`omega-v loop`, `omega-v swarm`, `omega-v integrity`)
- ✅ React / Vite Web Dashboard with live multi-agent swarm cards
- ✅ Reproducible container deployment (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `infra/nginx.conf`)

**Next Phase**: Advanced IR rule specifications & distributed ledger integrations.

See [MANIFEST.md](MANIFEST.md#verification-roadmap) for the full roadmap.

## How Decisions Are Made

This project follows **evidence-based decision-making**:

1. Proposals include evidence
2. All relevant evidence is presented
3. Consensus is sought; dissent is documented
4. When consensus cannot be reached, both paths are recorded
5. Verification determines which interpretation was correct

See [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md#how-we-make-decisions) for details.

---

## Code of Conduct

This community treats all contributors as co-observers seeking truth together:

- ✓ Disagree strongly on evidence
- ✓ Demand rigor and verification
- ✓ Help others learn and improve
- ✗ Dismiss ideas without evidence
- ✗ Attack the person, not the problem

See [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md#code-of-conduct) for full details.

## About the Name

**Ω∞v** represents:
- **Ω** (Omega) — The end and the infinite return
- **∞** (Infinity) — Continuous becoming and evolution
- **v** (Lowercase) — Humility and pluralism (no authority imposing meaning)

**Oceanicos** represents:
- The vast, interconnected system of observations and verifications
- Currents of formless intelligence flowing through evidence
- The observer within the ocean, recognizing their reflection

> Every end is a new beginning. Every becoming is a returning. Every step contains all steps.
