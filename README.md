## What Is Ω∞v?

Ω∞v Oceanicos is a system for building trustworthy software through continuous verification and evidence-based evolution.

### The Core Loop

```
Observe → Verify → Attest → Record → Display → Learn → Return
```

Every observation:
1. **Observed** with metadata (who, when, what, confidence)
2. **Verified** against rules with evidence paths
3. **Attested** with cryptographic signatures
4. **Recorded** in an immutable event log
5. **Displayed** to users and systems
6. **Learned** from to improve future verification
7. **Returned** to observation with better knowledge

### Why It Matters

Most systems assert correctness. We verify it.

- **Without verification**: "The system is healthy" (hope-based)
- **With verification**: "The system returned 200ms responses for 1000 consecutive requests; verified by rules v1.2.0; signed at 2026-08-07T10:30:02Z" (evidence-based)

## Key Principles

### 1. Verification Before Everything
No claim without evidence. No evolution without verification.

### 2. Continuous Observation
Systems are never final. Observation is ongoing.

### 3. Evidence-Based Trust
Trust emerges from verifiable provenance, not authority.

### 4. Graceful Pluralism
One system, many interpreters. Consensus and dissent both matter.

### 5. Recursive Completeness
Every component contains the whole verification loop.

## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Foundation

Start with these to understand the project:

- [MANIFEST.md](MANIFEST.md) — 5 min read on the vision
- [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md) — 10 min read on our principles
- [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — 15 min read on system design

### 2. Set Up Development

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/starofgodmayomi-droid/omega-v-oceanicos.git
cd omega-v-oceanicos

# Install
npm install

# Verify everything works
npm run verify
```

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed setup.

### 3. Pick a Contribution

Look for issues labeled:
- `good first issue` — Start here
- `help wanted` — Areas needing contributions
- `question` — Discussion and feedback

### 4. Read the Contribution Guide

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains:
- How to propose changes
- How to verify your work
- How to submit PRs
- Our review process

## Common Commands

### Development

```bash
# Start all services
npm run dev

# Run in watch mode
npm run watch

# Build everything
npm run build
```

### Verification

```bash
# Full verification (lint, test, build)
npm run verify

# Quick verification (lint, test only)
npm run verify:fast

# Comprehensive (full + coverage + integration)
npm run verify:full
```

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint              # Check code style
npm run lint:fix          # Fix style issues
npm run type-check        # Check TypeScript
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#common-commands) for more.

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation** (In Progress)

- ✅ Project manifest and charter
- ✅ Development setup and tooling
- ✅ Documentation structure
- ⏳ Core verification loop implementation
- ⏳ API server skeleton
- ⏳ Web dashboard skeleton

**Next Phase**: Core Loop Implementation (Step 2)

See [MANIFEST.md](MANIFEST.md#verification-roadmap) for the full roadmap.

## How Decisions Are Made

This project follows **evidence-based decision-making**:

1. Proposals include evidence
2. All relevant evidence is presented
3. Consensus is sought; dissent is documented
4. When consensus cannot be reached, both paths are recorded
5. Verification determines which interpretation was correct

See [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md#how-we-make-decisions) for details.

---

## Code of Conduct

This community treats all contributors as co-observers seeking truth together:

- ✓ Disagree strongly on evidence
- ✓ Demand rigor and verification
- ✓ Help others learn and improve
- ✗ Dismiss ideas without evidence
- ✗ Attack the person, not the problem

See [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md#code-of-conduct) for full details.

## About the Name

**Ω∞v** represents:
- **Ω** (Omega) — The end and the infinite return
- **∞** (Infinity) — Continuous becoming and evolution
- **v** (Lowercase) — Humility and pluralism (no authority imposing meaning)

**Oceanicos** represents:
- The vast, interconnected system of observations and verifications
- Currents of formless intelligence flowing through evidence
- The observer within the ocean, recognizing their reflection

> Every end is a new beginning. Every becoming is a returning. Every step contains all steps.
